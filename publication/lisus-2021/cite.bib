 abstract = {It is essential that a robot has the ability to deter-mine its position and orientation to execute tasks autonomously.Estimating heading is especially challenging in indoor environments where magnetic distortions make magnetometer-based heading estimation difficult. Ultra-wideband (UWB)transceivers are common in indoor localization problems. This letter experimentally demonstrates how to use UWB range and received signal strength  (RSS)  measurements to estimaterobot  heading. The RSS of a UWB transceiver varies with orientation of the transceiver. As such, a Gaussian process(GP) is used to learn a data-driven relationship from  UWBrange and RSS inputs to orientation outputs. Combined with agyroscope in an invariant extended Kalman filter, this realizes aheading estimation method that uses only UWB and gyroscope measurements.},
