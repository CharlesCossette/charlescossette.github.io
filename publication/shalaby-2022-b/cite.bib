 abstract = {Time-of-flight-based range measurements among transceivers with different clocks requires ranging protocols that accommodate for the varying rates of the clocks. Double-sided two-way ranging (DS-TWR) has recently been widely adopted as a standard protocol due to its accuracy; however, the precision of DS-TWR has not been clearly addressed. In this paper, an analytical model of the variance of DS-TWR is derived as a function of the user-programmed response delays. Consequently , this allows formulating an optimization problem over the response delays in order to maximize the information gained from range measurements by addressing the effect of varying the response delays on the precision and frequency of the measurements. The derived analytical variance model and proposed optimization formulation are validated experimentally with 2 ranging UWB transceivers, where 29 million range measurements are collected.},
