abstract = {The ability to accurately estimate the position of robotic agents relative to one another, in possibly GPS-denied environments, is crucial to execute collaborative tasks. Inter-agent range measurements are available at a low cost, due to technologies such as ultra-wideband radio. However, the task of three-dimensional relative position estimation using range measurements in multi-agent systems suffers from unobservabilities. This letter presents a sufficient condition for the observability of the relative positions, and satisfies the condition using a simple framework with only range measurements, an accelerometer, a rate gyro, and a magnetometer. The framework has been tested in simulation and in experiments, where 40-50 cm positioning accuracy is achieved using inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware.},

abstract = {The complex-step derivative approximation is a numerical differentiation technique that can achieve analytical accuracy, to machine precision, with a single function evaluation. In this letter, the complex-step derivative approximation is extended to be compatible with elements of matrix Lie groups. As with the standard complex-step derivative, the method is still able to achieve analytical accuracy, up to machine precision, with a single function evaluation. Compared to a central-difference scheme, the proposed complex-step approach is shown to have superior accuracy. The approach is applied to two different pose estimation problems, and is able to recover the same results as an analytical method when available.},

abstract = {Thoroughly assessing the performance of launch vehicle control systems often requires the use of high-fidelity simulation tools. In particular, launch vehicle control systems must take into consideration the effects of propellant slosh as well as a flexible structure in order to mitigate oscillations and follow a desired trajectory. This paper presents a method for deriving the equations of motion that couple the rigid-body, slosh, and flexible dynamics in an accessible and modular way. The formulation is generalized to an arbitrary number of propellant tanks and flexible modes, thereby being applicable to a variety of launch vehicles. The paper concludes with a numerical simulation of an example launch vehicle, showing the interaction of the different dynamics.},

@article{Shalaby2021a,
abstract = {It is often convenient to separate a state estimation task into smaller "local" tasks, where each local estimator estimates a subset of the overall system state. However, neglecting cross-covariance terms between state estimates can result in overconfident estimates, which can ultimately degrade the accuracy of the estimator. Common cascaded filtering techniques focus on the problem of modelling cross-covariances when the local estimators share a common state vector. This letter introduces a novel cascaded and decentralized filtering approach that approximates the cross-covariances when the local estimators consider distinct state vectors. The proposed estimator is validated in simulations and in experiments on a three-dimensional attitude and position estimation problem. The proposed approach is compared to a naive cascaded filtering approach that neglects cross-covariance terms, a sigma point-based Covariance Intersection filter, and a full-state filter. In both simulations and experiments, the proposed filter outperforms the naive and the Covariance Intersection filters, while performing comparatively to the full-state filter.},

abstract = {For a team of robots to work collaboratively, it is crucial that each robot have the ability to determine the position of their neighbors, relative to themselves, in order to execute tasks autonomously. This letter presents an algorithm for determining the three-dimensional relative position between two mobile robots, each using nothing more than a single ultra-wideband transceiver, an accelerometer, a rate gyro, and a magnetometer. A sliding window filter estimates the relative position at selected keypoints by combining the distance measurements with acceleration estimates, which each agent computes using an on-board attitude estimator. The algorithm is appropriate for real-time implementation, and has been tested in simulation and experiment, where it comfortably outperforms standard estimators. A positioning accuracy of less than 1 m is achieved with inexpensive sensors.},

abstract = {A coordinate system is proposed that replaces the usual three-dimensional Cartesian x, y, z position coordinates, for use in robotic localization applications. Range, azimuth, and elevation measurement models become greatly simplified, and, unlike spherical coordinates, the proposed coordinates do not suffer from the same kinematic singularities and angle wrap-around. When compared to Cartesian coordinates, the proposed coordinate system results in a significantly enhanced ability to represent the true distribution of robot positions, ultimately leading to large improvements in state estimation consistency.

Ultra-wideband (UWB)transceivers are common in indoor localization problems. This letter experimentally demonstrates how to use UWB range and received signal strength  (RSS)  measurements to estimaterobot  heading. The RSS of a UWB transceiver varies with orientation of the transceiver. As such, a Gaussian process(GP) is used to learn a data-driven relationship from  UWBrange and RSS inputs to orientation outputs. Combined with agyroscope in an invariant extended Kalman filter, this realizes aheading estimation method that uses only UWB and gyroscope measurements.},
