 abstract = {Thoroughly assessing the performance of launch vehicle control systems often requires the use of high-fidelity simulation tools. In particular, launch vehicle control systems must take into consideration the effects of propellant slosh as well as a flexible structure in order to mitigate oscillations and follow a desired trajectory. This paper presents a method for deriving the equations of motion that couple the rigid-body, slosh, and flexible dynamics in an accessible and modular way. The formulation is generalized to an arbitrary number of propellant tanks and flexible modes, thereby being applicable to a variety of launch vehicles. The paper concludes with a numerical simulation of an example launch vehicle, showing the interaction of the different dynamics.},
