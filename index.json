However, the range measurements typically suffer from a systematic error or bias that must be corrected for high-accuracy localization. In this paper, a ranging protocol is proposed alongside a robust and scalable antenna-delay calibration procedure to accurately and efficiently calibrate antenna delays for many UWB tags. Additionally, the bias and uncertainty of the measurements are modelled as a function of the received-signal power. The full calibration procedure is presented using experimental training data of 3 aerial robots fitted with 2 UWB tags each, and then evaluated on 2 test experiments. A localization problem is then formulated on the experimental test data, and the calibrated measurements and their modelled uncertainty are fed into an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed calibration is shown to yield an average of 46% improvement in localization accuracy. Lastly, the paper is accompanied by an open-source UWB-calibration Python library, which can be found at https://github.com/decarsg/uwb_calibration.","tags":[],"title":"Calibration and Uncertainty Characterization for Ultra-Wideband Two-Way-Ranging Measurements (preprint)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles Champagne Cossette","Mohammed Ayman Shalaby","David Saussie","Jerome Le Ny","James Richard Forbes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660239975,"objectID":"69fb95c0cc4750fd5ff0c4e9eda411e6","permalink":"https://charlescossette.github.io/publication/cossette-2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-11T17:46:15.432489Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cossette-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In multi-robot missions, relative position and attitude information between agents is valuable for a variety of tasks such as mapping, planning, and formation control.

This letter introduces a novel cascaded and decentralized filtering approach that approximates the cross-covariances when the local estimators consider distinct state vectors. The proposed estimator is validated in simulations and in experiments on a three-dimensional attitude and position estimation problem. The proposed approach is compared to a naive cascaded filtering approach that neglects cross-covariance terms, a sigma point-based Covariance Intersection filter, and a full-state filter.

You want to accomplish any of the following things:\n explore, map out, and inspect this area; search for people and dangers; set up lighting; set up an ad-hoc communication network; lay down wiring or put out fires.  Figure: A team of robots about to search a collapsed house.\nOur research ambition is to have a team of robots accomplish these tasks. One key challenge (amongst others), is that GPS doesn\u0026rsquo;t work indoors. This means that robots need to rely on other sensors, such as cameras or LIDAR, or\u0026hellip; as I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about later, ultra-wideband radio.\nFor a team of robots to work together, each robot needs to know where its teammates are, relative to themselves. That is, their relative positions.\nThis is a super important prerequisite for any sort of collaborative task, which could have applications in many areas:\n mapping; exploration; warehouse automation; multi-robot construction and site inspection.  So, how can we do this? And do so autonomously, in real-time, at high frequency (\u0026gt;10 Hz). If GPS were available, the robots would share their individual coordinates, subtract them, and this would give their relative positions. Cameras are a go-to solution for navigation in GPS-denied environments, and many have used cameras along with object detection to allow robots to visually identify their teammates. Cameras provide an enormous amount of information, but they often require demanding computer vision algorithms, an on-board GPU, good lighting conditions, and that the robots be within each other\u0026rsquo;s field-of-view.\nUltra-wideband Radio (UWB) At a very high level, imagine UWB as these little radios on each robot, which can be used to provide accurate distance measurements between robot.  Figure: Custom UWB radio module developed by our collaborators at Polytechnique Montréal. Credit: Justin Cano, Jérôme Le Ny. \nThese radios are cheap, lightweight, consume very little power, and also allow the robots to communicate wirelessly with each other.\nTraditionally, UWB has been used with transceivers located at fixed base stations, of known position, called anchors. This allows a robot to get distance measurements to all the anchors, and in turn calculate its position in space.  Figure: A typical usage of UWB radio, with transceivers at fixed base stations. \nHowever, we want to avoid using this fixed infrastrature. By putting transceivers on all the robots, we aim to use the distance measurements between the robots themselves to create a self-localizating, collaborative robot team, functioning at record-low cost, size, and weight.
