This letter presents an algorithm for determining the three-dimensional relative position between two mobile robots, each using nothing more than a single ultra-wideband transceiver, an accelerometer, a rate gyro, and a magnetometer. A sliding window filter estimates the relative position at selected keypoints by combining the distance measurements with acceleration estimates, which each agent computes using an on-board attitude estimator. The algorithm is appropriate for real-time implementation, and has been tested in simulation and experiment, where it comfortably outperforms standard estimators. A positioning accuracy of less than 1 m is achieved with inexpensive sensors.","tags":["\"Localization\"","\"multi-robot systems\"","\"range sensing\""],"title":"Relative Position Estimation between Two UWB Devices with IMUs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammed Shalaby","Charles Champagne Cossette","Jerome Le Ny","James Richard Forbes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619533993,"objectID":"061bc281b94e49c49b8ede34d4526305","permalink":"https://charlescossette.github.io/publication/shalaby-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T15:23:46.70253Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shalaby-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"It is often convenient to separate a state estimation task into smaller \\\"local\\\" tasks, where each local estimator estimates a subset of the overall system state. However, neglecting cross-covariance terms between state estimates can result in overconfident estimates, which can ultimately degrade the accuracy of the estimator. Common cascaded filtering techniques focus on the problem of modelling cross-covariances when the local estimators share a common state vector. This letter introduces a novel cascaded and decentralized filtering approach that approximates the cross-covariances when the local estimators consider distinct state vectors. The proposed estimator is validated in simulations and in experiments on a three-dimensional attitude and position estimation problem. The proposed approach is compared to a naive cascaded filtering approach that neglects cross-covariance terms, a sigma point-based Covariance Intersection filter, and a full-state filter. In both simulations and experiments, the proposed filter outperforms the naive and the Covariance Intersection filters, while performing comparatively to the full-state filter.","tags":["\"Covariance matrices\"","\"Distributed Robot Systems\"","\"Estimation error\"","\"Kalman filters\"","\"Noise measurement\"","\"Random variables\"","\"Sensor Fusion\"","\"State estimation\"","\"Task analysis\""],"title":"Cascaded Filtering Using the Sigma Point Transformation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles Champagne Cossette","Mohammed Shalaby","James Richard Forbes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620257399,"objectID":"c9daccbafc2ce1d5de281a3905108ec3","permalink":"https://charlescossette.github.io/publication/cossette-2021-b/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T15:23:47.217543Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cossette-2021-b/","section":"publication","summary":"It is essential that a robot has the ability to deter-mine its position and orientation to execute tasks autonomously.Estimating heading is especially challenging in indoor environments where magnetic distortions make magnetometer-based heading estimation difficult. Ultra-wideband (UWB)transceivers are common in indoor localization problems. This letter experimentally demonstrates how to use UWB range and received signal strength  (RSS)  measurements to estimaterobot  heading. The RSS of a UWB transceiver varies with orientation of the transceiver. As such, a Gaussian process(GP) is used to learn a data-driven relationship from  UWBrange and RSS inputs to orientation outputs. Combined with agyroscope in an invariant extended Kalman filter, this realizes aheading estimation method that uses only UWB and gyroscope measurements.","tags":[],"title":"Heading  Estimation  Using  Ultra-wideband  Received  Signal  Strength and  Gaussian  Processes (under review)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles Champagne Cossette","Mohammed Shalaby","David Saussie","James Richard Forbes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620257399,"objectID":"8bae3978a0bfa0a991251985fae2ebab","permalink":"https://charlescossette.github.io/publication/cossette-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T15:23:47.047934Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cossette-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"A coordinate system is proposed that replaces the usual three-dimensional Cartesian x, y, z position coordinates, for use in robotic localization applications.
